# Warlock — Specification

Status: refined draft v2 (2026-10-17)
Repository: https://github.com/jannef/warlock — used for code, documentation, issues, and pull requests.

## 1. Vision

Warlock is a turn-based, grid-based roguelike in the spirit of classic ASCII ADOM, rendered natively
on the GPU. Everything on screen — creatures, terrain, items, effects, UI — is a glyph. No tiles, no
real terminal.

It should feel far beyond the ASCII roguelikes of old: colored dynamic light with real shadows,
perception that depends on the viewer's eyes, living animated glyphs, and glyph-based particles and
shader effects — while every glyph stays readable.

Targets: native desktop on Windows, macOS, and Linux. A web build (WASM + WebGPU) is nice to have.

## 2. Scope of the first phase

Build the engine and framework, not the game. Everything built is production quality (§10).

**In scope**
- GPU glyph renderer with lighting, glyph animation, and effects
- Hand-authored levels from text files; multiple levels joined by stairs, each persistent
- Player movement (8 directions), doors (open/close), stairs
- Line of sight, terrain memory, gameplay lighting, vision types
- Inert test creatures walking fixed patrol routes
- Save and resume an unfinished run
- Keyboard controls with an in-game controls reference
- Development interface (§9)
- Procedural generation with reproducible seeds (M6): dungeon branches of generated levels
  (rooms and corridors, caves) with hand-made vaults, joined to the hand-authored levels by stairs

**Out of scope for now**: combat, statistics, item effects, AI, character creation, audio, mouse
input, overworld/wilderness map, infravision, localization.

Vision types are in scope even though there are no other mechanics yet: they are part of perception,
and the light data model must carry them from the start.

## 3. Showcase world

From M1 on, the playable build is a hand-authored **showcase world** where `@` walks through one room
per engine capability. Each milestone adds or upgrades rooms. The showcase world is also the
regression scene for golden screenshots, replays, and snapshot tests.

**Level 1 — Hub (80×21)**

| Room | Demonstrates | Milestone |
|---|---|---|
| Start room | movement, message line, `?` controls overlay | M1 |
| Door corridor | opening/closing doors, doors blocking sight | M1–M2 |
| Patrol gallery | creatures moving in and out of view, never shown in memory | M2 |
| Light hall | colored lights, falloff, pillar shadows, flicker | M3 |
| Darkness chamber | vision types, a UV-only rune, darkvision fade | M3 |
| Water garden | rippling water, pulsing altar, shimmer | M4 |
| Effects room | glyph particles, glow, fades, distortion | M4 |
| Stairs | connection to Level 2 | M2 |

**Level 2 — Vast (≥ 400×300)**: scrolling camera, many light sources, performance budget check.
Introduced in M2, lit in M3. Beside its stairs up to the hub, stairs down lead into the depths.

**The Depths (generated, M6)**: a dungeon branch of eight procedurally generated levels
(`depths:1` to `depths:8`; rooms and corridors at 80×21, caverns at 120×60 on depths 3–5) built
from the run seed, with vaults stamped in. The `depths` scenario starts on its first level.

## 4. Rendering

### 4.1 Glyphs
- A monospace TTF font is rasterized into a glyph atlas at the exact pixel size for the current zoom
  and display scale. Static glyphs are drawn 1:1 with nearest sampling, so they are crisp at any
  window size and DPI.
- Animated or scaled glyphs sample a supersampled copy of the atlas with linear filtering.
- Any Unicode glyph the font provides may be used (box drawing, blocks, arrows).
- Bundled fonts must have an OFL-compatible license. CP437 bitmap sheets may be added later as an
  alternative glyph source.

### 4.2 Layers
1. **Grid layer** — viewport-sized textures (glyph index, foreground, background, visual light,
   perception state) drawn as one quad with a custom 2D material. Terrain, remembered terrain, and
   in-cell animation.
2. **Free-glyph layer** — instanced glyph quads from the same atlas for actors, particles, and
   anything that moves between cells or grows beyond its cell. Lit by sampling the light texture.
3. **UI layer** — panels, message log, and overlays, drawn in glyphs.
4. **Post-processing** — glow/bloom, distortion, fades.

Rendering is viewport-based: drawing cost does not depend on level size.

### 4.3 Glyph animation
Declared in data per terrain or entity type:
- `wave` — ripple, e.g. water `~` swaying gently, with waves travelling across a pool
- `pulse` — heartbeat-style "lub-dub" grow/shrink
- `shimmer` — color oscillation
- `cycle` — glyph frame sequence, e.g. `~` ↔ `≈`

Each cell gets its own phase from a hash of its position, so neighbors never move in lockstep.
Animation that stays inside the cell runs in the grid shader; animation that exceeds the cell (a
pulse above 1.0 scale) uses the free-glyph layer.

### 4.4 Visual lighting
- Derived from gameplay light (§5), plus visual-only modulation: flicker and transient effect lights
  (e.g. a spell's glow). Visual-only light never affects gameplay.
- Each frame, the CPU composites the perceived light of the viewport's cells (plus a one-cell
  margin) from the perception snapshot — ambient light plus every visible source's per-cell
  contribution — into a viewport-sized float texture aligned with the map grid. The shader
  interpolates it per pixel between cell centers for smooth gradients; a neighbor contributes only
  if it is visible and transparent, so light never bleeds across walls or corners, nor into unseen
  or remembered cells. Walls show their own wall-face light, flat.
- A surface's base color is its look at full light (255). Below that it dims linearly (in linear
  light) to a readability floor; overbright light brightens it a little more along a soft knee and
  adds a faint glow in the light's own color, so strongly lit floors pool with color.
- **Flicker** is per source (preset `flicker = { amount, speed }`): smooth noise from the source's
  stable key and visual time, applied as a per-cell brightness gain (the mean of the flicker of the
  sources lighting the cell, weighted by their light) after shading, so it reads the same in dim
  and bright light. Gentle by design: brightness drifts within ±`amount`, no strobing.
- **Darkvision**: a cell seen only through darkvision gets a faint monochrome glow that dims toward
  the edge of the darkvision radius, and its color fades toward monochrome as it gets darker and
  farther from the viewer: saturation = 1 − darkness · (1 − 0.3 · (1 − distance / radius)) with
  darkness = 1 − brightness / threshold. Full color at the threshold, 30 % in total darkness next
  to the viewer, monochrome in total darkness at the edge of the radius.
- **UV light** is drawn (as a violet tint) only when the viewer has UV sight.
- Free glyphs (creatures, pulsing terrain) are lit by the same light, sampled at their center.

### 4.5 Perception states
- **Visible** — fully lit rendering, including creatures and effects.
- **Remembered** — dim, desaturated terrain as last seen. Never creatures, effects, or current light.
- **Unknown** — blank.

### 4.6 Motion and time
- Visual time runs continuously while gameplay waits for input. Animation never blocks or changes
  gameplay.
- Moving glyphs slide between cells over ~80 ms; the camera follows smoothly. Any new input
  completes running animations instantly, so fast play never waits.
- Visual randomness uses its own RNG and never consumes gameplay randomness.

### 4.7 Readability and reduced effects
- Glyphs stay legible under every effect: minimum contrast against their background, glow added
  around glyphs rather than over them, small distortion amplitudes.
- A **reduced effects** setting turns off glyph animation, flicker, sliding (instant snap), camera
  easing, bloom, and distortion, and minimizes particles. No gameplay information may depend on an
  effect. It is a setting (§6); the `--reduced-effects` flag forces it on.
- **Color palettes** (default, high contrast, a red-green colorblind variant) are transforms
  applied when colors are written to the screen, so game data colors are never altered. UI text
  keeps at least 4.5:1 contrast, and the UI never conveys information by color alone (selection
  has a `>` marker, refusals start with `!`).

## 5. Visibility, light, and vision

These are gameplay rules. They live in `warlock-core`, are deterministic, and never depend on frame
rate or animation.

- **Line of sight**: symmetric shadowcasting (if A sees B, B sees A). Walls and closed doors are
  opaque. Radii are Euclidean with a slightly rounded edge: a cell is within radius `r` iff
  `d² ≤ r² + r`. The maximum view range is 40.
- **Light**: each cell's light is integer **RGB + UV**, one `u16` per channel: **255 = fully lit**
  (a surface shows its base color), more is overbright. A cell's light is the level's ambient light
  (`ambient = [r, g, b, uv]`, default 0) plus the sum of all sources that reach it (saturating).
- **Light sources** come from light presets (`color = [r, g, b, uv]`, which is also the intensity,
  and `radius`): terrain that emits light, lights placed on cells by the level legend (overriding
  the terrain's own), creatures that carry light, and the player's lantern (from the scenario,
  toggled by the player; takes a turn). Emitters must be transparent; a source in an opaque cell
  (e.g. on a closed door) gives no light. Presets also carry visual-only flicker, never read by
  rules.
- **Falloff and shadows**: a source shadowcasts with the same shadowcasting within its radius and
  adds `color · (R² − d²) / R²` with `R² = r² + r`: full color at the source, monotonically less
  with distance, zero at the edge. Integer math only — no floating point or transcendental
  functions in gameplay.
- **Wall faces**: an opaque cell's perceived light is the channel-wise maximum light of the adjacent
  (8-neighborhood) transparent cells the viewer sees — applied per source, then summed with ambient
  light. This prevents light leaking through walls.
- **Brightness** is the integer luma of RGB, `(54·r + 183·g + 19·b) / 256`, plus UV for eyes that
  see UV. Eyes without UV sight do not perceive UV at all (perception reports it as 0).
- **Visibility**: a cell is visible iff it is in line of sight within the maximum view range **and**
  (its perceived brightness ≥ the eye's threshold **or** its distance ≤ the darkvision radius). The
  player's own cell is always visible. Creatures are seen iff their cell is visible: creatures in
  darkness are hidden (unless within darkvision), creatures carrying light are seen.
- **Wall completion**: an opaque cell within the view range that is 8-adjacent to a transparent cell
  seen by light or darkvision is visible too, even outside line of sight, so floor seen through a
  narrow, irregular gap is never shown without the walls bounding it. (The player's own cell, which
  is visible regardless of light, does not complete walls: in total darkness the player sees only
  themselves.) Such a cell reveals only its terrain and wall-face light — never creatures, and
  nothing beyond it.
- **Vision profiles** are data (`data/vision.toml`). First version:

  | Profile | Light threshold | Darkvision radius | Senses |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Normal | 40 | 0 | visible light |
  | Low-light | 12 | 0 | visible light |
  | Darkvision | 40 | 5 | visible light |
  | UV sight | 40 | 0 | visible + UV light |

  The scenario sets the starting profile. The dev action `SetVision` switches it; it takes no game
  time but is recorded in replays like any action. Infravision is deferred.
- **Memory**: per level, terrain only, as last seen (a door is remembered open until seen closed).
- **Recomputation**: perception updates in the perception phase of every turn (and after
  `SetVision`). Per-light shadow masks are cached and invalidated when the light moves or opacity
  changes within its radius; only sources whose radius can reach the view range are evaluated.
- **Perception API**: the snapshot exposes, for visible cells only, the perceived light (after the
  wall-face rule; plus whether the cell is seen only through darkvision and its squared distance),
  the light sources whose light reaches visible cells (stable key, position, preset, and per-cell
  contributions; contributions plus ambient sum to the cell's light), the active vision profile,
  and the ambient light. Visual lighting (§4.4) is derived from this.

## 6. Input and UI

- Keyboard-first. Default sets: vi-keys (`hjklyubn`), numpad, arrows (4 directions).
- Symbol commands (`<`, `>`, `?`) are bound by **logical key**, so they work on non-US layouts.
- Bindings live in the settings file. The `?` controls overlay is generated from the binding table,
  so it is always accurate.
- **Main menu** (drawn in glyphs; the game opens on it unless `--scenario`, `--new`, `--replay`,
  `--record`, or `--capture` name what to run): Continue (only if a save exists), New run
  (scenario list from content, optional seed), Settings, Controls, Quit.
- **Pause menu**: Esc during a run (when no prompt or overlay is open) opens it, drawn in glyphs:
  Resume, Settings, Controls, Save and quit to menu, Quit (which saves). No game time passes while
  it is open; Esc or Back in Settings/Controls returns to it.
- **Settings** (`settings.toml` in the platform config dir; never on the web): font size (logical
  px, 12 to 36), reduced effects, color palette, key bindings. A missing or damaged file means
  defaults and a logged warning. Changes apply live (a font size change rebuilds the glyph atlas)
  and are written immediately.
- **Rebinding**: in Controls, select a command and press a key; it becomes the command's primary
  key (alternates such as the numpad stay). A key another command uses is refused and the owner
  is named, so the table never holds a conflict. Esc (cancel) is fixed. Delete resets a command,
  "Reset all keys" resets everything.
- First-phase commands: move, wait, open/close door, ascend/descend, light/douse lantern (`L`),
  look, help, save and quit (`Q`). Free actions (look, help, menus) do not advance time.
- Screen layout: map viewport, message log, status panel (turn, position, level, light at the
  player, vision profile, seed).

## 7. Levels and data formats

Rule: **hand-authored data is TOML; machine-written data is JSON.**

- **Level files** (TOML): a header (name, ambient light, legend, lights, patrols, stair links) plus a
  multiline ASCII map. Level size comes from the map, with no fixed upper limit: most dungeon levels
  are about 80×21, some are vast. The camera scrolls when a level is larger than the viewport. The
  same format defines vaults for procedural generation (below). Illustrative only — exact syntax
  is designed in M1:

  ```toml
  name = "Hub"
  ambient = [8, 8, 12, 0]  # r, g, b, uv
  map = '''
  ##########
  #@..T...+.
  #..~~~..#>
  ##########
  '''

  [legend]
  "#" = "wall"
  "." = "floor"
  "+" = "door_closed"
  "~" = "water"
  "T" = { terrain = "floor", light = "torch" }
  ">" = { terrain = "stairs_down", to = "vast" }
  "@" = { terrain = "floor", spawn = "player" }

  [[patrol]]
  creature = "rat"
  path = [[12, 3], [20, 3], [20, 8]]
  ```
- **Definitions** (TOML): terrain types, light presets, vision profiles, glyph animations.
- **Dungeon branches** (`data/dungeons.toml`): stacks of generated levels, e.g.
  `{ id = "depths", generator = "rooms", depth = 8, size = [80, 21] }`, plus optional name,
  patrolling creature kinds, ambient light, and per-depth overrides of generator and size. Stairs
  (and scenarios) may target `depths:N`; content validation accepts such ids when the branch has
  that depth. A branch level is generated on its first visit from its own random stream (§8) and
  then persists like a hand-made level. Its `<` leads to `depths:N-1` (on depth 1, back to the
  level it was first entered from), its `>` to `depths:N+1` (the deepest level has none).
- **Generators** (`warlock-core`, integer-only): *rooms* — walled rooms joined along a minimum
  spanning tree plus a few loops by corridors dug as cheapest paths (bends cost extra), with closed
  doors, open doors, or doorways where corridors enter, and wall torches in most rooms; *caves* —
  cellular automata (45 % rock, five 4-5 smoothing passes, largest cave kept), pools of water,
  lamps and glowing fungus. Both place the up staircase (the arrival point) and the down staircase
  far from it, and a few creatures on looping patrols. Every level is validated by flood fill —
  every stair, door, and walkable cell reachable from the up staircase, patrols valid, some light
  — and a level that fails is regenerated from the next derived stream.
- **Vaults** (`assets/vaults/*.toml`): hand-made pieces in the level-file format, stamped verbatim
  (terrain, lights, creatures) where they fit — into rock with room for corridors or tunnels to
  every entrance. A vault's edge is solid except for its entrances (doors, not on a corner); it has
  no stairs or player start, and all its walkable cells are reachable from an entrance.
- **Scenarios** (`assets/scenarios/*.toml`): level set, start position, vision profile, lantern,
  options.
- **Saves**: suspend-only. One save per run, written on quit and by periodic autosave; loading
  continues the run. Dev builds add named snapshots. Format: a versioned envelope (magic, format
  version, game version) around a JSON payload, gzip-compressed with a pure-Rust backend, written
  atomically (temp file + rename). Before 1.0, incompatible saves are rejected with a clear message;
  from 1.0 on, saves are migrated. The web build uses browser storage. The envelope also records a
  content fingerprint (hash of the ordered terrain, creature, level, light, and dungeon-branch
  ids), because ids are indices; a save made with different content is rejected. Generated levels
  are saved with the run like visited hand-made ones (terrain, memory, stairs, lights), together
  with the gameplay random stream. The save is `run.sav` in the platform
  data directory. `Q` saves and quits (closing the window saves too), autosave runs every 50 turns
  and on level change, and a save that cannot be read is renamed `run.sav.bad`, never deleted, while
  a new run starts. Starting resumes the save unless `--new` is given. Dev snapshots: `F5` saves and
  `F9` loads `snapshots/quick.sav` (debug builds or `--dev`).
- **Settings**: a separate file in the platform config directory.
- **Replays**: JSON action logs with a header (game version, scenario, seed) and per-turn state hashes.
- **Dumps**: JSON simulation state plus ASCII layers.

## 8. Architecture

```
crates/
  warlock-core/   plain Rust, no Bevy: map, actors, actions, turns, fov, light,
                  perception, rng, levels, mapgen, save
  warlock-cli/    no Bevy: scenarios, replay, dump, verify
  warlock/        Bevy app: render, input, UI, effects, platform (ECS lives here)
xtask/            screenshot capture, golden-image diff, CI helpers
assets/           fonts, levels, scenarios, vaults, definitions, shaders
```

- **Pure core**: `warlock-core` has no Bevy dependency, no platform I/O inside the rules, and no
  wall-clock time. It builds and tests in seconds and is insulated from Bevy upgrades.
- **Data layout**: dense grids for terrain, light, and memory; a simple entity store with stable ids
  for actors. ECS is used in the presentation layer, where it helps with effects, particles, and
  animation.
- **Perception snapshot**: after each turn, the core produces what the player perceives. The
  renderer, UI, and dumps read only this snapshot, so hidden information cannot leak by construction
  (a dev "reveal" mode excepted).
- **Turn phases**, in order: player action → creatures (stable id order) → environment → perception
  (line of sight, light, memory) → emit presentation events.
- **Events to effects**: the core emits events (door opened, actor moved); the presentation layer
  turns them into animations. Gameplay never waits for them.
- **Determinism**: ChaCha8 RNG (`rand_chacha`) with separate streams, each seeded with FNV-1a 64 of
  the run seed (little-endian) and a label: map generation per level (`map/<level id>`, retry *k*
  `map/<level id>/<k>`), so a level depends only on the seed and its id, never on visiting order;
  gameplay (`gameplay`, kept in the world state and saved); and visual-only randomness in the app,
  which never uses either. No hash-order iteration and no floating point in the core's decisions.
  The same seed and actions produce the same result within a game version; seeds are not
  guaranteed stable across versions, and snapshot tests flag when generator output changes. A seed
  is a number or a word (`--seed warlock`, hashed with FNV-1a 64).
- Small modules with clear responsibilities; no speculative abstractions or premature optimization.

## 9. Development interface

```
warlock --scenario showcase --seed 42                     # play a named scenario
warlock --replay runs/doors.json \
        --freeze-time 1.5 --window 1280x720 --scale 1 \
        --capture out.png                                 # reproducible screenshot, then exit
warlock --record runs/new.json                            # record actions for bug reproduction
warlock-cli dump --scenario showcase --actions "move:N move:N" \
        --format ascii --layers view,fov,memory           # text view of the simulation
warlock-cli dump --replay runs/doors.json --format json --state   # structured dump
warlock-cli replay --create --scenario showcase --actions "move:N wait" -o runs/x.json
warlock-cli replay --verify runs/doors.json               # check per-turn state hashes
warlock-cli gen --level depths:3 --seed warlock           # print a generated level (dev-only)
cargo xtask golden [--update]                             # compare golden screenshots
```

- Replays are JSON: `{game_version, scenario, seed, steps: [{action, hash}]}`. Actions use a text
  syntax (`move:E wait open:E close:W ascend descend lantern vision:darkvision`); `hash` is the
  FNV-1a 64 hash of the
  canonical JSON encoding of `WorldState` after the step. Verification reports the first
  diverging step. `--replay` takes its scenario and seed from the file; `--record` rewrites its
  file after every action (including replayed steps).
- Dump layers: `view`, `fov`, `memory`, `light` (perceived brightness of each visible cell as a
  digit, `0` dark to `9` fully lit or brighter) are built from the perception snapshot only;
  `truth` shows ground truth and is dev-only. JSON dumps carry turn, level,
  viewer, seen actors, recent messages, and optionally the full world state.
- Freezing visual time and fixing window size and scale make screenshots reproducible. With frozen
  time, glyph animations show that moment and motion (slides, camera) completes instantly.
- Dev builds add in-game commands: switch vision profile (`F3`), reveal map (`F2`, ground truth,
  marked as dev-only on screen), toggle debug overlays (light values `F4`; line of sight and memory
  later), save and load named snapshots (`F5`/`F9`). They are in the bindings table, so the `?`
  overlay lists them.
- CLAUDE.md documents build commands, architecture notes, pinned documentation references, and
  verification procedures, including the agent workflow guidance from the original brief.
  Verification uses tests, dumps, logs, and screenshots — a successful compile alone does not
  verify rendering.

## 10. Quality bar (Definition of Done)

- CI (Linux) is green: `cargo fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`, tests, headless screenshots, a
  `wasm32` compile check, `cargo-deny`. macOS is verified locally before every PR (development
  happens there); macOS does not run in CI.
- Core: unit tests; property tests for line-of-sight symmetry and for sight and light never passing
  through walls; snapshot tests of ASCII dumps; replay determinism tests.
- Renderer: golden screenshots per showcase room, compared on Linux CI with software Vulkan.
  Reference images are updated deliberately, never automatically.
- No panics on player paths; errors are shown to the player gracefully; `tracing` logs go to a file
  in release builds.
- Every milestone ends with a downloadable, playable build for each OS, published by the tagged
  release workflow (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- Performance budgets (proposed; to be confirmed on reference hardware): 60 fps at 1440p on an
  integrated GPU; turn processing ≤ 5 ms in the hub and ≤ 16 ms in the vast level.
- The spec and CLAUDE.md are updated together with behavior changes.

## 11. Technology

| Area | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Rust (stable) | |
| Engine | Bevy 0.20.x, `default-features = false` | Pinned; upgrades are deliberate tasks. 0.19 and 0.20 postdate most model training data, so pinned docs and examples are mandatory. No audio, 3D, or glTF features. |
| Shaders | WGSL (WESL-compatible) | Bevy 0.20 adopted WESL; plain WGSL remains valid. |
| Font rasterization | chosen in M1 | Bevy's text stack or a dedicated rasterizer. |
| RNG | ChaCha8 | Pinned algorithm with stable output. |
| Serialization | serde + JSON, TOML | bincode rejected: permanently unmaintained (RUSTSEC-2025-0141). |
| Testing | cargo test, proptest, insta | |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | CI on Linux only (software Vulkan for screenshots); release archives for Linux, Windows, and macOS on tags. |
| Web | wasm32 + WebGPU | Compile check from M0; real web build in M7. |

## 13. GitHub workflow

All through the `gh` CLI:
- Milestones M0–M7 as GitHub milestones; one issue per task.
- Labels: `area:core`, `area:render`, `area:input`, `area:tools`, `area:ci`, `area:docs`;
  `type:feature`, `type:bug`, `type:chore`.
- One pull request per issue, referencing it; CI required; squash merge into `main`.
