# Special rooms

Developer notes for special rooms (spec §7 "Special rooms"; the second wave's design is
`docs/design/special-rooms.md`). Moved out of `docs/dev/mapgen.md` in #402: every special-rooms
change edits this file, not the generator notes.

## Data

`data/room_effects.toml` (`content/room_effect.rs`): the shared `chance` (12 % per room) and
`per_level` (1), and one `[[effect]]` per kind of special room (a **feature**), at most 32, ids are
indices (in the save fingerprint; new effects go at the end). Fields: `id`, `name`, `mark` (the
`rooms` dev layer), `enter`, `weight` (1 to 100, default 10), `near` (optional), `level_chance`
(percent, default 0) and `pervade` (needed with it), the eligibility fields `needs_danger`,
`needs_below`, `min_cells`, `max_cells` ([`RoomEffectDef::eligible`]), and what it does: `light`,
`glow`, `noise`, `regen`, `mana_regen`, `shunned`, `floor`. An effect with `level_chance` must have
a `pervade` line and be neither `shunned` nor lay a `floor` (`RoomEffectDef::can_pervade`); a level
file's `effect` is held to the same.

Features today: shadowed (10), echoing (8), hushed (8), sanctuary (6), flooded (8), black chamber
(5, `light = 0`). None has a `level_chance` yet (cursed and draining rooms bring theirs).

A dungeon's `room_effects` (on a branch or a `[[dungeon.levels]]` range; `content/dungeon.rs`,
`RoomOddsSpec::layer`/`resolve`, field by field: the range's, the branch's, the shared file's)
sets `chance`, `per_level`, `favoured = { id = share, ... }` (fixed shares in percent, 1 to 100,
together at most 100) and `banned = [ids]`, resolved into `RoomOdds { chance, per_level,
favoured, banned }` (`RoomOdds::shared` has neither list). Content errors: unknown ids, an id both
favoured and banned, shares over 100, every feature banned while `chance` is above 0, and the
retired `effects` list (refused, pointing to `favoured` and `banned`). Fennmynster favours flooded
35, hushed 15, shadowed 15 (its cursed share and its bans on hot rooms and forges come with those
rooms).

## Generation

`mapgen/special.rs`, last, from the level's map stream, so levels without a special room keep
their terrain. Per candidate (each room of a rooms level but the arrival room and vaults; each of
eight cave chambers): `roll` (the chance, while the level has fewer than `per_level`, a pervading
effect counting as one), then the room is found (a cave chamber's middle is picked first), then
`pick`: `draw` among the features not banned that the room is eligible for (its floor cells, the
level's danger: `Canvas::danger` = the level has a danger rule, `Canvas::below` = it has a level
below), then, for a feature with a `level_chance` and while nothing pervades yet, one more draw:
the feature covers the level (`Canvas::pervading`) and the room stays plain. `place` then makes
the room (`make`: its floor, no overlap, a shunned room never where a creature patrols).

`draw`: if any eligible feature is favoured, one draw in 0..100 walks the favoured ones in effect
order by their shares; past them (or with none favoured), a weighted draw by `weight` over the
eligible features that are not favoured; if that set is empty, over the favoured ones by their
shares. With no favoured feature the first draw is skipped. Adding a feature changes what
existing seeds draw (the Depths' snapshots changed once, in #402).

Fixture branches in `mapgen/tests.rs` (`FIXTURE`) check that a branch favouring only flooded rooms
makes only flooded rooms; `mapgen/special_tests.rs` checks the shares over many draws, a feature
added in a test table turning up in a dungeon that never names it, `level_chance`, and
eligibility.

## State and the one question

`LevelState::rooms` (`SpecialRoom`: effect, box, a blob's cells, `entered`, `glimpsed`) and
`LevelState::pervading: Option<RoomEffectId>` (from the template: a level file's top-level
`effect`, never on the overworld; or the generator's draw), saved and hashed, each left out while
empty, so other levels hash as before. The rules ask one question, `LevelState::effects_at` (public:
`World::effects_at`), which returns a `Here { room, level }`; every reader folds it the same way
(`Here::light`, `shade`, `glow`, `noise`, `regen`, `mana_regen`, `shunned`): percents multiply,
glows add, flags OR. Readers: perception light and creature sight together (`room_shade` on every
part of a cell's light, `room_glow` in the base light; change `perception.rs` and `sight.rs`
together, `special_rooms_keep_the_light_invariants` and `light_tests::check_invariants` check they
agree), noise (`noise::noise`, `World::sound_at`), `World::healing_rate` and `World::mana_rate`
(the room's pace through `World::room_pace`, where Hallowed rest adds half again to a quickening),
and `World::shuns` (`ai.rs`, by the room only: no pervading effect is shunned). A flooded room's
slower, louder steps come from its floor terrain. `PerceptionView::light_kept` lets the renderer
dim its own transient light.

## What the player is told

`world/rooms.rs`: `glimpse_rooms` (in `perceive`, before `enter_room`) marks each room of which
the player sees a cell `glimpsed` and says its `near` line, unless they are inside it;
`enter_room` (`world/travel.rs`) says `enter` once per room and marks it entered and glimpsed;
`pervade_line` is said on every arrival on a pervaded level (`World::travel`, and at the start of
a run), with Sense of place followed by what the effect is. `PerceptionView::room` names a room
once entered (with Sense of place, once glimpsed) on cells seen or remembered; look mode reads it.
`PerceptionView::pervading` is the whole level's effect (JSON dumps: `pervading`); look mode does
not name it. The `rooms` dev layer marks each room's plain ground, lists each room with
`entered`/`glimpsed`, and heads with `pervading <id>`.

## Talents

System `special_rooms` (`data/talents.toml`): Sense of place (wayfarer, `sense_of_place`; hook
`PerceptionView::room` and `pervade_line`) and Hallowed rest (grit, `room_pace_percent` 50; hook
`World::room_pace`).

## Tests

`content/room_effect.rs` (fields, defaults, refusals, `Here` folding), `content/dungeon.rs`
(`favoured`/`banned` resolve and layer, the refusals), `mapgen/special_tests.rs` (the draw),
`mapgen/tests.rs` (how often levels get one, the fixture branches, the snapshots),
`mapgen/fennmynster_tests.rs`, `world/room_tests.rs` (each effect in play, messages, pervading
levels, the talents, saving).
